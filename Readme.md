# Typetron
> **Note:** This project is a prototype in heavy development and not ready for production. 

**[Typetron](https://typetron.org)** is a **modern web framework** built for Node.js, written in **Typescript**, that
allows you to build fully featured web applications. 
Typetron is best suited for small sized to enterprise level apps.
Most of the core packages it uses were built from scratch in order to preserve the performance of the framework.
